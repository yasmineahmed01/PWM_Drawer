# PWM_Drawer
Amit Graduation Project

# Description – PWM drawer:
❑ PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible 
for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated 
PWM signal.
❑ The generated wave came from two sources, external sources 
(e.g. generated PWM from other MCs), or internal source of 
the Microcontroller of the project itself

# Specification – Graphical LCD:
❑ With the graphical LCD we can display the following:
• The shape of the generated PWM from internally or 
externally sources.
• The frequency in KHz of the generated wave on the upper 
left side of the LCD.
• The duty cycle of the generated wave on the upper right 
side of the LCD.
• The time of the single cycle.

# Components you may need:
1. Micro-controller (ATmega32, or equivalent).
2. Graphical LCD.
