# PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) generation from TIMER2

1.Configure the TCCR2 register to set the mode of operation, clock source, and prescaler for TIMER2.


2.Enable the PWM output on a specific pin of the microcontroller by setting the appropriate bit in the DDR register.

3.Set the duty cycle of the PWM signal by setting the appropriate value in the OCR2 register.
